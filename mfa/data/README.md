## Wines Data Set

This folder contains the data set `wines.txt` for the final project.

The data concerns 12 wines made from Sauvignon Blanc grapes coming from three 
wine regions (4 wines from each region): New Zealand, France, and Canada. 

Ten expert assessors were asked to evaluate these wines. The assessors were
asked:

1. to evaluate the wines on 9-point rating scales, using four variables
considered as standard for the evaluation of these wines: cat-pee, passion-fruit,
green pepper, and mineral. 

2. if they felt the need, to add some variables of their own: some assessors
choose none, some choose one or two more variables.
